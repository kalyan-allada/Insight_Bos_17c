Welcome to LeetCode activity, I will push one question per day from Tuesday to Thursday for next three weeks. Please spend no more than 2 hours per question. 

Here are the instructions: 

1. `$ git pull` (to obtain most up-to-date files)

2. `$ cd problem_*)`. you will see the question written in Python format. For example, cd problem_1, the question file is named linked_list.py

3. Make a copy of this question file and move to "Fellow Codes Go Here" folder, and rename the question file to your name. For example, mine would be ivan_zheng.py. Please note that, since the autograder takes the files from "Fellow Codes Go Here" foder, it is critical that you follow this instruction. 

4. When you are happy with your codes, please remember to commit it so I can see it. 

Have fun coding~~
